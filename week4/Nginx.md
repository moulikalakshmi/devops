# Nginx Web Server Setup on Amazon Linux 2023

## What is a Web Server?
A web server is software or hardware that serves web content to users over the internet. It processes incoming requests from clients (such as web browsers) and delivers requested web pages, images, videos, or other resources.
Web servers like Apache, Nginx, and IIS primarily serve static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and act as reverse proxies, forwarding requests to backend applications. They do not process backend logic directly. Instead, they work with application servers to handle dynamic content.
## What is a Reverse Proxy?
A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client requests and backend servers. It forwards incoming requests from users to one or more backend servers and returns the response to the client.

## Types of Web Servers
There are several types of web servers, categorized based on their functionality and usage:

### 1. Apache HTTP Server (Apache)
- **Developer:** Apache Software Foundation  
- **Pros:** Open-source, highly customizable with modules, widely used.  
- **Cons:** Performance issues under heavy traffic compared to newer web servers.  
- **Best for:** General-purpose web hosting, PHP-based applications like WordPress.  

### 2. Nginx
- **Developer:** Igor Sysoev  
- **Pros:** High-performance, efficient resource usage, good for handling concurrent connections, built-in reverse proxy and load balancing.  
- **Cons:** Configuration can be complex for beginners.  
- **Best for:** High-traffic websites, static content delivery, and reverse proxy use cases.  

### 3. Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services)
- **Developer:** Microsoft  
- **Pros:** Integrated with Windows Server, easy to use with ASP.NET applications.  
- **Cons:** Limited to Windows environments.  
- **Best for:** Windows-based applications and enterprises using Microsoft stack.  

### 4. Tomcat (Apache Tomcat)
- **Developer:** Apache Software Foundation  
- **Pros:** Specially designed for running Java Servlets and JSP applications.  
- **Cons:** Not a general-purpose web server, only for Java-based applications.  
- **Best for:** Java-based applications and APIs.  

### Which One is the Best?
The best web server depends on your needs:
- **For general-purpose hosting:** Apache or Nginx.  
- **For high-performance and scalability:** Nginx or LiteSpeed.  
- **For Windows-based applications:** IIS.  
- **For Java applications:** Tomcat.  
- **For simple and secure web hosting:** Caddy.  

**Best Overall Choice:** Nginx is considered one of the best web servers for performance, security, and scalability, making it a top choice for modern web applications.

## Why Use Nginx?
- **High Performance:** Handles multiple concurrent connections with low resource consumption.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic efficiently among multiple servers.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Improves security by hiding backend services.
- **Security Features:** Supports TLS/SSL termination, request filtering, and more.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for small to large-scale applications.
