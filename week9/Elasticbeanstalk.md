# Deploying a Java Spring Boot Application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## Overview

**Elastic Beanstalk** is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offered by AWS that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling applications. It abstracts infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus on code. 

### Why Use Elastic Beanstalk?

- **Simplicity:** Handles provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and monitoring automatically.
- **Managed Service:** No need to manage servers or OS updates.
- **Quick Deployment:** Ideal for standard web applications and APIs.

### Why Use Elastic Beanstalk Instead of EKS or ECS?

Elastic Beanstalk is the preferred choice when you want to deploy web applications quickly without managing the underlying infrastructure or container orchestration. It abstracts away the complexity of provisioning servers, configuring load balancers, and managing scaling, allowing you to focus on your application code.

**Use Elastic Beanstalk when:**
- You want a fully managed platform for standard web apps or APIs.
- You do not need advanced container orchestration or microservices patterns.
- You prefer minimal configuration and fast deployments.
- You want AWS to handle OS updates, scaling, and monitoring automatically.

**Use EKS or ECS when:**
- You require Kubernetes (EKS) or advanced container management (ECS).
- Your application architecture is based on microservices or complex containerized workloads.
- You need fine-grained control over networking, scaling, and deployment strategies.

For most straightforward Java Spring Boot web applications, Elastic Beanstalk offers the fastest and simplest path to deployment.

## Steps to Deploy a Spring Boot Application on Elastic Beanstalk

### 1. Prepare the Spring Boot Application

- **Build the Application:**  
    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    ```
    This creates a `.jar` file in the `target` directory (e.g., `target/yourapp.jar`).

---

### 2. Set Up Elastic Beanstalk Environment

1. **Login to AWS Console:**  
     Navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk service.

2. **Create a New Application:**  
     - Click **Create Application**.
     - Name your application.
     - Select **Java** as the platform.

3. **Configure Environment:**  
     - Choose a platform branch compatible with your Java version (e.g., Java 17 on 64bit Amazon Linux 2).
     - Set instance type, environment type (single or load balanced), and key pair for SSH access.

---

### 3. Deploy the Application

1. **Upload and Deploy:**  
     - In the Application code section, select **Upload your code**.
     - Upload the `.jar` file from the `target` directory.
     - Click **Deploy**.

### 4. Configure Service Access

#### Set Up the Service Role

1. Go to **Configuration > Security** in Elastic Beanstalk.
2. Under **Service Role**:
     - Create a new service role or use an existing one (e.g., `aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role`).
     - Ensure it has the `AWSElasticBeanstalkService` policy.
3. View permission details to confirm necessary permissions.

#### Select an EC2 Key Pair

1. In the EC2 key pair section:
     - Select an existing key pair or create a new one.
     - To create a new key pair:
         - Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
         - Navigate to **Key Pairs > Create Key Pair**.
         - Name and download the key pair.
     - Select the key pair in Elastic Beanstalk.

#### Configure the EC2 Instance Profile

1. Choose `beanstalk-instance-profile` as the EC2 instance profile.
2. Ensure it has policies like `AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier` and `AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier`.
3. View permission details to confirm access to S3, CloudWatch, EC2, etc.

### 5. Configure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

- Configure VPC settings as needed for your application's networking and security requirements.

---

### 6. Monitor Deployment

- Elastic Beanstalk provisions resources (EC2, Auto Scaling, Load Balancer, etc.).
- Monitor progress in the AWS Console.

---

### 7. Configure Updates, Monitoring, and Logging

- Set up application and environment updates.
- Enable monitoring and logging for troubleshooting and performance tracking.

---

## Summary

Elastic Beanstalk is ideal for quickly deploying Java Spring Boot applications without managing infrastructure. For more complex, containerized, or microservices-based workloads, consider AWS EKS or ECS.
