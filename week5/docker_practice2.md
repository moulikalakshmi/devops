# EC2 Maven vs Docker: Why Use Docker if Maven Creates an Executable JAR?

## 1. Maven: Creates an Executable JAR
- Maven builds the application and packages it as a `.jar` file.
- Includes all dependencies, making it portable on systems with Java installed.
- **Limitations:**
  - Requires Java to be installed separately.
  - Might face OS compatibility issues.
  - Does not include system-level dependencies.

## 2. Docker: Creates a Containerized Image
- Docker packages the application **along with** Java, system dependencies, and configurations.
- Runs consistently across different OS and cloud environments.
- **Advantages:**
  ✅ No need for Java installation on the host machine.
  ✅ Works identically across dev, test, and prod.
  ✅ Simplifies cloud and Kubernetes deployment.

## 3. When to Use What?
| Scenario | Maven (JAR only) | Docker |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Controlled environment | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| Different OS (Windows/Linux) | ❌ Might break | ✅ Works |
| Cloud & containerized deployment | ❌ Manual setup needed | ✅ Easy deployment |
| Microservices & scalability | ❌ Harder to manage | ✅ Perfect for microservices |

## 4. Best Practice: Use Both
1️⃣ **Use Maven** to build the JAR (`mvn package`).
2️⃣ **Use Docker** to containerize it (`docker build -t myapp .`).

By combining Maven and Docker, you get **portability + consistency**, making deployments easier and more reliable. 🚀
